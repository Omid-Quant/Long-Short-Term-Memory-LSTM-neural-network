# Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network
Impacts of Macroeconomics factors on stock Prices

Stock Price Forecasting using LSTM
This project focuses on forecasting stock prices in the US using data obtained from the OECD website. The project leverages a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), to predict future stock prices based on historical data and key economic indicators.

Project Overview
The project is structured into the following key steps:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: The data is loaded from an Excel file and preprocessed to ensure it is in a suitable format for analysis and modeling.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): The data is visualized and analyzed to understand trends, correlations, and stationarity.

Feature Selection: Key features that are most correlated with stock price changes are identified.

Model Setup: An LSTM model is set up with optimal hyperparameters based on the analysis.

Model Training and Evaluation: The LSTM model is trained on the data and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
